A few years later, (through divine intervention or cosmic irony depending how you look at it) I was admitted to the University of Oxford, where I studied philosophy. After I discovered that nobody wanted to pay me for thinking, I took a job at Harley-Davidson. Flushed with funds and bored with motorbikes, I set out on a glamorous new career as a film producer in America. There, I produced some spectacularly unsuccessful films before I discovered an enthralling new trend: \"Transmedia\". I became fascinated with ARGs and their novel approach to audience engagement. I absorbed everything I could find on the subject. Back in Europe, whilst working on a VOD platform I started experimenting with ARGs in schools. Ironically, these experiments were successful and what I learned I would like to share with you.",

      "biography": "Der Journalist und Schriftsteller G\u00fcnter Wallraff enth\u00fcllt seit f\u00fcnfzig Jahren Missst\u00e4nde in unserer Gesellschaft, wie Ausbeutung, Rassismus und Unterdr\u00fcckung. Besonderes Aufsehen erregte Wallraff mit seinen verdeckten Recherchen innerhalb der Redaktion der \u201eBild-\u00ad\u2010 Zeitung\u201c als Hans Esser. \"Ganz unten\" aus dem Jahr 1985, Wallraffs Reportage in der Rolle des t\u00fcrkischen Arbeiters \"Ali\" als illegaler Bauarbeiter \u00fcber den menschenverachtenden Handel mit Leiharbeitern, ist mit \u00fcber f\u00fcnf Millionen verkauften Exemplaren das meistverkaufte Sachbuch im Nachkriegsdeutschland. Verdeckt war Wallraff vor kurzem als der obdachlose \u201eWolfgang\u201c in Nachtasylen und vor den Schreibtischen von Sachbearbeitern in Wohnungs\u00e4mtern, als Call\u2010Agent \u201eMichael G.\u201c im \u201eOutbound\u201c\u2010Gesch\u00e4ft oder als Paketauslieferer bei GLS besch\u00e4ftigt. Seine Erfahrungen sind in dem jetzt in Neuauflage erschienen Buch \u201eAus der sch\u00f6nen neuen Welt\u201c zu finden. F\u00fcr gro\u00dfe Resonanz sorgten zuletzt seine Enth\u00fcllungen \u00fcber Burger King, die Pflegebranche oder das Wach- und Sicherheitsgewerbe mit dem \u201eTeam Wallraff\u201c auf RTL.\n\n_____\n\nJournalist and writer G\u00fcnter Wallraff has revealed injustices in our society such as exploitation, racism and oppression for 50 years. Wallraff created a particular sensation with his undercover research inside the Bild Zeitung\u2019s editorial team as \u201cHans Esser\u201d. His 1985 report \u201cGanz unten\u201d (At the bottom), in which Wallraff took on the role of the Turkish \u201cAli\u201d, an illegal construction worker, in order to examine the inhuman treatment afforded to temporary workers, remains the best-selling non-fiction book in post-war Germany, with more than 5 million copies sold. More recently, Wallraff went undercover as the homeless \u201cWolfgang\u201d, sleeping in overnight shelters and meeting housing-services case officers; as call-centre agent \u201cMichael G.\u201d in \u201cOutbound\u201d; and as a package-deliverer employed by GLS. His experiences can be found in the newly published book \u201cAus der sch\u00f6nen neuen Welt\u201d (From the Brave New World). His recent revelations about Burger King, the long-term care industry, and the private security business, produced for his RTL show \u201cTeam Wallraff\u201d, have drawn a strong public response.\n\n\u00a0\n\nG\u00fcnter Wallraff is a speaker @MEDIA CONVENTION Berlin\n\nFind out more on Twitter: @MCBERLIN15 / #mcb15\n",

Seit Anfang 2014 verkauft er auch sein erstes vollkommen selbst produziertes und vertriebenes H\u00f6rbuch \u201eGleisheiten\u201c und tourt damit auf Slams und Leseb\u00fchnen quer durch Deutschland.\n\nAuf der re:publica 2015 tritt Paul Weigl im MIZ_innovationspace@rp15 des MIZ-Babelsberg auf.",

So wurden beim Medienfassaden Festival Europa 2010 erstmalig sieben europ\u00e4ische Gro\u00dfst\u00e4dte \u00fcber Urban Screens und Medienfassaden vernetzt, die sich u.a. w\u00e4hrend gemeinsamer Joint Broadcasting Events als Sichtfenster f\u00fcr gesellschaftliche und interkulturelle Prozesse \u00f6ffneten. Die Auseinandersetzung mit urbanen Medien f\u00fchrte Susa Pop 2011 als Projektleiterin des vom Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung und Forschung gef\u00f6rderten Innovationsforum Urban Screens fort. Weitere Projekte von Public Art Lab sind: Mobile Museen (2004), Mobile Studios (2006), Mobicases (2007, 2009, 2011), Medienfassaden Festival (2008 ) und Round Table Ukraine (2011-13). Im April 2012 erscheint zudem die, unter der Mitherausgeberschaft von Susa Pop entstandene, Publikation Urban Media Cultures (Verlag avedition). Anhand zahlreicher Beispiele aus den Themengebieten Stadtentwicklung, Technologie und Vermarktung zeigt das Buch aktuelle Tendenzen im Bereich interaktiver Medienstrukturen. Connecting Cities (seit 2012) ist ein aktuelles Projekt von Public Art Lab bei dem Susa als Initiatorin, internationale k\u00fcnstlerische Leisterin und lokaler Kurator in Berlin agiert. Weitere aktuelle Projekte sind Human Futures (2012-14), sowie das City Culture Science Lab (2015).",

Along with serving as presenter for a variety of shows on ZDF, RTL, ProSieben, and Sat 1, among other positions, she began her acting career with a 2007 debut in the ZDF telenovela \u201cWege zum Gluck\u201d, reaching a high point in 2009 with the role of the killer Mercedes in the feature film \u201cKilling is my Business, Honey\u201d (Mord ist mein Gesch\u00e4ft, Liebling). However, Lee is not only active in front of the camera on TV. With her own YouTube channel and active Twitter and Facebook communities, she is one of the few presenters in Germany to build an early and successful bridge between TV and social media. For this reason, she was honoured with a melty Future Award in January 2015 in the category \u201cCool is Everywhere \u2013 Germany\u201d.

He began covering energy markets as a Reuters correspondent in the Middle East in the early 1990s.\u00a0He has consulted to the United Nations, Revenue Watch Institute, Internews and others on oil and the public policy aspects of the industry and published in the Petroleum Economist, Iraq Oil Report, and Critical Resources as well as more general media like the Guardian and Huffington Post.\u00a0His book\u00a0Karama! Travels Through the Arab Spring, was the first book-length account to be published of the events now rocking the Middle East.\n\nJohnny's new project, backed by a fellowship from the Shuttleworth Foundation, is Gaiabase, the world's first open source database of natural resources. We are already running up hard against planetary boundaries in our unprecedented exploitation of the Earth's natural resources, and with world population projected to reach 10 billion by 2050 these issues are only going to become more acute. For responsible global policy making, we will need access to full, open and structured data sets around the world's natural resources. Gaiabase aims to achieve that both by curating all information in the public domain now and evolving new crowd-sourcing techniques to map systematically the full social, environmental and economic footprints of the world's extractive industries.\u00a0",

In den 1990er Jahren waren die Konturen einer und die Diskussion \u00fcber eine Wissensgesellschaft weiter als heute. Es herrscht der Biedermeier. Warum? Weil wir, die Wissensarbeiter, die Gestaltung der Zukunft den Leuten \u00fcberlassen, die schon die Vergangenheit verbockt haben. N\u00fcchtern betrachtet: Die Rahmenbedingungen der Wissensarbeit, meist selbst\u00e4ndig und in Projekten, zeigt den Stellenwert. Es fehlen auch nur halbwegs angedachte Alternativen zum alten 9-to-5 Job. Das Rad wird zur\u00fcckgedreht: Nicht nur bei Yahoo sollen die Leute wieder an die Schreibtische, damit ein \u00e4ngstliches und unsicheres Management sich r\u00fcckversichern kann. Wissensarbeit braucht Methode, Theorie, Konzentration und Organisation. All das fehlt der neuen Arbeit (w\u00e4hrend sich die alte Arbeit perfekt b\u00fcrokratisiert hat). Das ist ein Aufruf zur Professionalisierung, zu einem breiten Diskurs dar\u00fcber, was wir brauchen, worauf wir Wissensarbeiter uns konzentrieren wollen, wie die St\u00e4dte und Kieze aussehen sollen, in denen wir arbeiten, und welche neuen Regeln Arbeit, Gesellschaft und Kultur brauchen. Dauer 15 minutes/freie Rede\n\nWolf Lotter ist Autor (\u201eZivilkapitalismus\u201c) und Vortragender, Journalist (z.B. brandeins, zu dessen Gr\u00fcndungsmitgliedern er z\u00e4hlt) und denkt pausenlos \u00fcber die Transformation von der alten Industriegesellschaft zur Wissensgesellschaft nach.",

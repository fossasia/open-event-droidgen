It's exciting to see testing happen at such a large scale. However there is an issue, it is too difficult for humans to deal with all the data being generated or analyze all the results from the testing. To deal with this the OpenStack community has developed and deployed several tools to help deal with the torrent of data. Using and building off these tools have been invaluable especially as the OpenStack project continues to grow. This talk will explain the basics of OpenStack's CI infra and cover the approach and tooling used by the OpenStack community to interact with the large amount of test result. It will explain the techniques used and the benefits derived from having both open test result data and performing analysis on that data to understand the project.</span></p>",

Researching deeply about Virtual Reality during that period, Lionel realised this emerging technology could be the game-changer for media and content, and thus - quit his job, packed his bag and uprooted himself and his family to move to London to pursue a Masters degree in Creative Technology; specialising in Augmented and Virtual Reality. There, he produced London’s first ever 360 Virtual Reality Dance staged at Middlesex University and also Singapore Inside out (London) a VR experience (<a href=\"http://www.sgiolondon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.sgiolondon.com</a>) for the the touring exhibition by Singapore Tourism Board.

For many query, this is not the best way to optimize them: you need to rethink and rewrite them completely. To do this, you need to know how optimizer and executor work, and keep that in mind while composing your queries. In this talk, I will present an overview of a few less known and rarely used techniques such as:</span><span style=\"\">* using and implementing loose index scan for different scenarios;</span><span style=\"\">* using IOS in situation where it isn't applicable directly;</span><span style=\"\">* replacing IN (long list of values) with JOIN VALUES ();</span><span style=\"\">* moving a limit or offset clause inside joins;</span><span style=\"\">* and other tricks with row types and arrays of row types.</span><span style=\"\">Using these techniques and some other ideas, we will learn how to optimize a 'friends feed/subscription news' query, which is a typical task in many projects. We will diretcly compare performance of four different approaches: direct approach (simplest query), optimized direct approach (more complicated version of it), pl/pgsql with different algorithms, and implementation of this pl/plsql code in plain sql. I will show how this approach can convert almost any read-only non-dynamic (no EXECUTE statements and no exceptions) pl/pgsql code to a plain sql query.</span></p>",

Applications range from controlling computers, machines, biofeedback, to quantified self tracking. At first sight, the current generation of commercial devices seem to be decent in their functionality, and various use cases are suggested. However, neurophysiological signal quality, as well as limitations of software and hardware hackability are among the greatest issues and hurdles towards advancement in user experience. This is why we started to work on Brain-Duino, an open-source brainwave amplifier shield for the Arduino and other microcontrollers.</p><p style=\"\">Brain-Duino is a high quality, low noise and affordable EEG / BCI for hackers, makers, researchers, artists and other enthusiasts. This talk will be about how the Brain-Duino project started, where it is now and where it is going. We will briefly explain how EEG brain-computer interfaces work, and also why this topic is relevant, together with the current advances in artificial intelligence and hardware.</p><p style=\"\">During the FOSSASIA you will have the chance to try out the Brain-Duino and visualize your brainwaves.</p>"

So, is this true? Is there a mismatch between the designer and the community? Are there differences in participants' expectations?- Should the designer be involved in the project from the beginning to the end? - Should the designer be also a technical person? - Should the designer be responsible for the implementation of his proposals? - What we request in a design work is realistic and according to designer's specialty? - How can we evaluate a designer's proposals inside our community? - Can we have more than one designer involved in the community? - Do we know our target and provide full specifications when requesting design work? - Who should have the final decision on design proposals? - Is the designer responsible for all the usability problems of the project?- Why it is so easy to provide design feedback?- etc.All the above are valid questions when interacting with designers in open source communities and some times the answers don't match. Stating very clear what the expectations are can be helpful in having long term design contributions. In this presentation we will go over the common questions and expectations designers and open source communities have and try to provide a base for design work interactions.</p>",

Servers coordinate themselves automatically when they are part of the same group. The group can operate in a single-primary mode with automatic primary election, where only one server accepts updates at a time. Alternatively, for more advanced users the group can be deployed in multi-primary mode, where all servers can accept updates, even if they are issued concurrently. There is a built-in group membership service that keeps the view of the group consistent and available for all servers at any given point in time.</p>",

In this presentation we describe the proposed approach and current progress of a recently funded two year project. During this project, we are developing a proof of concept system showing how semantic based machine translation can, in conjunction with robust computational grammars, be used to interact with students, better understand their language errors, and help students correct their grammar through a series of useful feedback messages and guided language drills.</span><span style=\"\">Ultimately, we aim to prove the viability of a new integrated rule-based MT approach to disambiguate students’ intended meaning in computer-assisted language teaching. This is a necessary step to provide accurate coaching on how to correct ungrammatical input, and it will allow us to overcome the current bottleneck in Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) – an exponential burst of ambiguity caused by ambiguous lexical items.</span></p>",

The work has been done in association with a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) called SAHI,  Society to Aid the Hearing Impaired which is part of Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad. SAHI supports the hearing impaired kids for Cochlear implant surgery so that the kids audibility increases. After the surgery audio therapy is given to kids for better understanding of the surrounding world. By using free and open source web applications, MIT App Inventor, various mobile Apps have been developed for the better learning of the kids. The learning of the impaired kids have been cleared explained by the special teachers to the developers. This made to develop Apps more clearly, concisely and perfectly. Different Apps were done keeping in the view of international standard of teaching to special kids who are hearing impaired. The Apps developed covered variety of topics such as Early Vocabulary,Vehicle and Voice Sounds, Syllable Length Word (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu), Discriminate Consonant, Same Length Words (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu), Leaning by Manner, Learning of Colors, Learning various Poems (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu) and explaining short Stories(in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu). The Apps have been done in both English and native languages too keeping in view of the therapy requested by the kid's parents. Tests are also included in the Apps to know the level of learning. During initial stages, suggestions were given by audiologists, special teachers and counselors. After continuous and rigorous reviews and feedbacks, the apps developed had become satisfactory to all the special trainers and was ready to use. They were given to the challenged kids for testing as a part of their learning. The results found by the teachers were astounding. Children are showing more interest to learn on mobile rather than book. The duration of attention  towards learning of the kid has drastically improved. Teachers training the special kids are very happy with this m-learning (Mobile learning). Parents too found it to be amazing as their kids show more interest towards learning through mobile. Also, now they are very much comfortable to train the kids at their homes by using these Apps. The parents are very excited to get all these learning Apps shared to their mobiles.  It  is a great feeling of satisfaction to see kids interested to learn and the parents with bright smile on their face. This all happened by developing learning Apps of open-source software. Over all it's an awesome experience !!</span></p>",

This gives rise to the need for heterogeneous computing.Heterogeneous computing refers to systems that use more than one kind of processor or cores. </span><span style=\"\">These systems gain performance or energy efficiency not just by adding the same type of processors, but by adding dissimilar co-processors, usually incorporating specialized processing capabilities to handle particular tasks.</span><span style=\"\">There are a number of heterogeneous devices that are readily available off the shelf, some of them as commercially available system on chips (SoCs) and can be easily accessible to the average embedded software programmer. These heterogeneous devices incorporate hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and FPGAs. The advantages of having multiple types of hardware accelerators within a system on chip are many, such as high-performance gains and specificity of tasks performed. One of the major issues is the exotic programming model that each hardware accelerator brings along with it. </span><span style=\"\">FPGAs bring along the requirement to write accelerators using hardware description language (HDL) at a very low level of abstraction (register transfer level) which has a really steep learning curve, extremely long compilation/place and route timings and are relatively difficult to debug. GPUs have their own programming languages and until a few years ago GPUs were used predominantly for graphics processing as the name suggests. However off late, with computing problems of large sizes and datasets, a lot of computations are being off-loaded to the GPU due to its benefit in parallel execution. </span><span style=\"\">Even with a great number of devices available, the difference in programming models makes it difficult to truly use all these devices in unison. </span><span style=\"\">Even with these multitudes of methods available for hardware acceleration, it is still not possible for software developers to adopt and use these devices as part of their daily routine for hardware acceleration. In order to achieve the full potential of hardware acceleration, multiple heterogeneous devices within the same SoC must be programmable using a single programming model and also the programming model must be portable across devices without loss of functionality. The aim of this talk is to throw light on the OpenCL(Open Computing Language API) and its potential for being the one single language that can be used to program multiple devices.</span></p>",

Google and Government of India initially started a contest to crowd source the features and design of the appOur team won the contest in the end and were to make the official app for the PMO. I was the lead Android developer of the team. I will be talking about how we worked with the government and will talk about five aspects of the app - Development, scalability, security, release and maintenance. I will talk about localization of apps as our app is currently targeting 10 regional languages in India with dynamic content. We had to get multiple security clearances from different government and private agencies due to the nature of the app which included automated source code testing, white boxtesting, blackbox testing and manual testing. Due to the expected high load on the app, we did multiple load tests on the app before launch to configure servers and load balancers. Finally I will talk about the release process of the app and the ongoing maintenance.Contest Details - <a href=\"http://www.google.co.in/intl/en_in/landing/pmoapp/Details\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.google.co.in/intl/en_in/landing/pmoapp/Details</a> about the release - <a href=\"https://india.googleblog.com/2016/08/with-new-app-prime-minister-is-just-tap.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://india.googleblog.com/2016/08/with-new-app-prime-minister-is-just-tap.html?m=1</a></p>",

Similarly, there is a huge selection of free professional-quality software, in particular (but not only) related to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Yet all too often, students are only taught to use computers for basic word processing or presentations and never learn to tap the computer’s power as a versatile problem-solving tool, even if it could be readily applied at school, in their future careers, and at home.</p><p style=\"\">In my presentation, I will demonstrate a few examples of free software we use routinely in our STEM teaching and research lab in areas such as computer-assisted mathematics, mechanical design, electronic circuit design, and data analysis.</p><p style=\"\">The ultimate key to take control of the computer as a tool is the ability to program it. The Python programming language is rightfully popular in education, academia and industry alike as it is easy to learn, yet extremely expressive and powerful. I will show examples of how we/our students use Python to simulate engineering designs before prototyping, control experiments, and acquire and process data.</p><p style=\"\">I will close by discussing why free software is not just about the money, and how some attractive-looking free-of-charge software or online service schemes can actually hurt students by taking their freedom away.</p><p></p>",

As these cities become increasingly complex systems of people and interconnected infrastructure, extreme weather events and long term environmental changes pose acute challenges for disaster response and humanitarian action.</span><span style=\"\">Although rapidly urbanizing environments are often thought to be “data scarce,” by enabling residents to share emergency data openly and in real time, <a href=\"http://PetaBencana.id\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaBencana.id</a> makes a wealth of information available that promotes resilience to extreme weather events. By gathering, sorting, and visualizing data, <a href=\"http://PetaBencana.id\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaBencana.id</a> transforms the noise of social and digital media into critical information for residents, communities, and government agencies. The platform adopts a  “people as sensors” paradigm, where confirmed reports are collected directly from the users at street level in a manner that removes expensive and time-consuming data processing. This framework creates accurate, real-time data which is immediately made available for users and first responders.</span><span style=\"\"> </span><span style=\"\">The CogniCity OSS was designed, tested, and deployed as an operational platform in Jakarta during a three-year (2013-2016) applied research project. As a “proof of platform,” the free web-based flood map <a href=\"http://PetaJakarta.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaJakarta.org</a> was used by hundreds of thousands of residents during monsoon flooding. It is was also adopted by the Jakarta Emergency Management Agency (BPBD DKI Jakarta) to monitor flood events, to improve response times, and to share emergency information with residents.</span><span style=\"\"> </span><span style=\"\">CogniCity OSS proved the value of crowdsourced social and digital media for emergency response through the <a href=\"http://PetaJakarta.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PetaJakarta.org</a> platform, but this use of open data for humanitarian disaster response is only a first step. Additional CogniCity OSS modules are in development at the MIT Urban Risk Lab to address other hazards, including earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, typhoons, and terrorism. CogniCity OSS is also being designed to integrate and coordinate additional data sources, including various instant messaging services. And, as CogniCity OSS is deployed as a disaster risk management system in other Asian megacities, additional platform extensions and innovations will provide additional support for humanitarian response to urban disasters.</span></p>",

Fortunately, nowadays most of the firmware/hardware vendors share the code from the open source project, edk2, in their own UEFI implementations, so it's much easier to understand the how the firmware works, especially the hardware-independent software stack. What's even better is that edk2 contains a sub-project, OVMF, to provide the firmware for QEMU, the virtual machine, we don't need a bare metal to implement features or debug hardware independent issues anymore. No more expensive flash programmer, just copy the file to update the firmware immediately. This talk will present how to develop and debug OVMF with openSUSE and introduce the new UEFI features in openSUSE Leap 42.2.</p>"

Today, we’re taking this mission one step further, by bringing openness to the most important intellectual production of humanity: knowledge itself. And we’re not doing it alone, but with the help of institutions and professors all around the globe.</span></p><p><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">What is WikiToLearn? </span><span style=\"\">WikiToLearn is an open platform where students, researchers and key people in the academia can create and refine notes and text books, tailored precisely to their needs, and giving them the power to customise the teaching beyond what traditional textbooks allow. Our philosophy inherits from the very foundation of how science works. We believe that “Knowledge only grows if shared” and we want learners to “Stand on the shoulder of giants!”</span><span style=\"\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Why is it an innovation?</span><span style=\"\">WikiToLearn does not offer new knowledge. WikiToLearn offers a new approach to knowledge: it rediscovers and repurposes the attitude, now almost forgotten by mankind, that led our civilisation to take the huge steps that have brought us here today, with our endless heritage of knowledge. Without the collaboration and the communication among the people, without the free availability of knowledge, no big discovery would have been possible. This is what we are trying to restore. We are driven by the love for free knowledge, owned by no one and accessible to everyone. </span><span style=\"\">As volunteers, freely collaborating between us, we want to make this vision possible. Open source gains in this context a profound and significant meaning, merging naturally with our philosophy.</span><span style=\"\">Any content can be modified: this leads to a continuous development of the existing material, to the collaboration and communication among learners.</span><span style=\"\">Everything on WikiToLearn is freely accessible and can be downloaded: in this way knowledge is made available to everyone.</span><span style=\"\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"\">         </span><span style=\"\">Why should I contribute?</span><span style=\"\">It is really important that users contribute to the writing and the improvement of the contents. This is the only way the project can be successful and be able to continue to grow. Your contribution, as small as it could be, is and will always be fundamental.</span><span style=\"\">Finding already existent, well organised and freely accessible material can be really useful. However, always bear in mind that you can find it only because someone decided to contribute to creating it.</span></p><p><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Moved/Driven by what? Perhaps by our same vision: the desire to see, at last, a change in the approach to knowledge. Perhaps because so you can really feel useful and part of something great, with the power change the world.</span></p><p><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">Who can contribute?</span><span style=\"\"> </span></p><ul><li><span style=\"\">I’m a university student, I don't have time for this...</span><span style=\"\">Your contribution is, of course, not solely dedicated to making WikiToLearn bigger: writing and summarising are excellent tools that will help you to prepare for exams, as well as to improve your explanation skills. Moreover, this is often the best way to realise what you did not understand, and in case you make a mistake, someone will correct you.</span></li><li><span style=\"\">But I'm a professor!- </span><span style=\"\">WikiToLearn is an excellent workout for the students, but it is also a really useful tool for the teachers.</span><span style=\"\">Reviewing the notes of your students will help you to be aware of their understanding of each lesson, which gives you valuable feedback on the effectiveness of your teaching. You can then customise your classes in order to optimise the educational path.</span><span style=\"\">The students will consolidate their knowledge by writing their notes in a more organised way and, thanks to your thorough checking and improving, they will be able to create evolving, evolving, exhaustive, proofread and beautifully formatted textbooks.</span></li><li><span style=\"\">I’m a coder! - </span><span style=\"\">Do you want to help WikiToLearn \"under the hood\"? This is the right page for you to get started! First of all, you do not need to be a super expert in Computer Science: there are plenty of things to do at all skill levels. You can also count on the help of our developers to help get you on track to contribute immediately! WikiToLearn is a project based on MediaWiki, so we always need developers to fix bugs and develop new innovative programs. If you’re interested in contributing to open source software, WikiToLearn can be a great place.</span></li><li><span style=\"\">I’m a translator!</span><span style=\"\"> - </span><span style=\"\">Are you fluent in (at least) two languages? WikiToLearn needs you!</span><span style=\"\">Translating on WikiToLearn is an opportunity to practice your translation skills, at the same time you will learn about new things, and you will contribute to the growth of knowledge in the world . The content does not need to be written from scratch, the translation into several languages is as important as the content itself, to guarantee its accessibility to everyone.</span></li></ul><p>Who \"makes\" WikiToLearn? - The project is promoted and coordinated by a community of people, often experts in their own field, who write, review and organise the content.

        "short_abstract": "<p>The Shogun Machine learning toolbox provides a wide range of unified and efficient Machine Learning (ML) methods. The toolbox seamlessly allows to easily combine multiple data representations, algorithm classes, and general purpose tools. This enables both rapid prototyping of data pipelines and extensibility in terms of new algorithms. We combine modern software architecture in C++ with both efficient low-level computing backends and cutting edge algorithm implementations to solve large-scale Machine Learning problems (yet) on single machines.One of Shogun's most exciting features is that you can use the toolbox through a unified interface from C++, Python, Octave, R, Java, Lua, C#, Ruby, etc. This not just means that we are independent of trends in computing languages, but it also lets you use Shogun as a vehicle to expose your algorithm to multiple communities. We use SWIG to enable bidirectional communication between C++ and target languages. One of the focus point of the talk is the introduction of the meta-example framework developed as part of the toolbox: a user can write an example use-case for a method using our 'meta-example' syntax, that would then be auto-translated into all of the supported languages of the library. This not only allows us to easily scale with the number of new methods in the sense of having the example use-cases of the method being exposed to all of the target languages, but it allows us to have those methods tested throughout of all the languages.Originally focussing on large-scale kernel methods and bioinformatics, the toolbox saw massive extensions to other fields in recent years. It now offers features that span the whole space of Machine Learning methods, including many classical methods in classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, but also more advanced algorithm classes such as metric, multi-task, structured output, and online learning, as well as feature hashing, ensemble methods, and optimization, just to name a few. Shogun in addition contains a number of exclusive state-of-the art algorithms such as a wealth of efficient SVM implementations, Multiple Kernel Learning, kernel hypothesis testing, Krylov methods, etc. All algorithms are supported by a collection of general purpose methods for evaluation, parameter tuning, preprocessing, serialisation &amp; I/O, etc; the resulting combinatorial possibilities are huge.</p>",

The permission and/ grant includes the grant to use, to redistribute, to prepare derivative works etc. These software licenses also set forth the limitations over these aforesaid rights. The software licenses basically marks the boundary for the usage of the code.Therefore from the above mentioned introduction it very clear that it is very important for developers to choose the license for their code wisely and correctly.Pypi, the Python Package Index is a repository of software for the Python programming language. There are currently 80000+ packages there.This talk will go through the licenses of the top 2500 packages. We will see the trend of choosing a license for these top Python projects. We will discuss the licenses individually, compare them with each other. the advantages and disadvantages of the same.We will further explain that why a license and/or licenses are being favoured by the developers.Outline of my talk:Introduction of the SpeakerWhat is Copyright?What is a software license?The Kinds of licensesWhat is the PyPI project?Graphs and charts explaining the license usagePython Packages in Fedora landDetails of these FOSS licensesThe advantages and disadvantages of various FOSS licensesComparison of the sameWhat are the points to be kept in mind while choosing a license</p>",

The talk focuses on two things, namely the CLTK core software and CLTK Archive, an interactive reading environment.</span><span style=\"\">The CLTK core is a Python library that offers natural language processing support for Classical languages (namely, those of ancient Eurasia, from earliest civilizations through the beginning of the modern era). It can be seen as an extension of NLTK, but with special consideration for the unique needs of historical languages. It provides basic functions for many languages (e.g., n-grams, word frequencies, word tokenization) and wider support for several languages (Greek and Latin) that includes text normalization, sentence tokenizer, POS tagging, and named entity recognition (NER). We plan to extend to other languages, as well.</span><span style=\"\">The CLTK Archive is a website I worked on during my GSoC project. It's a web app front-end to the CLTK core and also provides a modern reading environment for interacting with ancient texts. The Archive aims to provide an aesthetically-pleasing yet utilitarian environment that facilitates reading, note taking, and learning. It presents Classical texts in an easy-to-read layout with metadata like translation, commentary, and word definitions. The site is backed up by a Flask based REST API that provides access to text corpora and other functions of the core CLTK package. </span><span style=\"\">I will also be giving a short demos of the capabilities of the Python library and CLTK Archive website (available soon as an alpha release).</span></p>",
